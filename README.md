A Spigot Plugin for simple, yet configurable quickly setup hunger games with friends. Whole game experience can get enriched with **random leveled drops** and **player position reveals**. Has a working **pardon system for disconnects** and players stay in spectator mode instead of getting banned on death.

You'll have to build it yourself right now. But I might change that.
